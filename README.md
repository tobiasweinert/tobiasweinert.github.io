## Description

This website serves as an extension of my curriculum vitae (CV), providing an interactive and dynamic representation of me and my educational journey. It's designed to showcase my skills and experiences in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner. Also, I've always wanted to try out Three.js so this was the perfect opportunity to do so.

Since this project also is a playground for me to test things out the code quality is terrible and things are expected to break 😌

## Features
- **Three.js:** Displays the slides in a carousel that rotates and snaps to the slides.
- **Tween.js:** Smooth animations for different use cases.

## Usage
To rotate the carousel and change the visible slide the user can pick one of three methods:
- Drag, rotate and drop the carousel
- Use the arrow keys (left/right)
- Use the scroll wheel (up/down)

## Demo
Check out the live demo [here](https://tobiasweinert.github.io/).
