## Description

This website serves as an extension of my curriculum vitae (CV), providing an interactive and dynamic representation of me and my educational journey. It's designed to showcase my skills and experiences in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner. Also, I've always wanted to try out Three.js so this was the perfect opportunity to do so.

Since this project is also used as a playground to test things out the code quality is terrible and things are expected to break ðŸ˜Œ

## Features
- **Three.js:** Displays the slides in a carousel that rotates and snaps to the slides.
- **Tween.js:** Smooth animations for different use cases.
- **Shaders:** GLSL Shaders

## Usage
To rotate the carousel and change the visible slide the user can pick one of three methods:
- Drag, rotate and drop the carousel with the mouse
- Use the arrow keys (left/right)
- Use the scroll wheel (up/down)

## Demo
Check out the live demo [here](https://tobiasweinert.github.io/).
